			<p>See the <a href="download.html">download</a> page for help build and installing OpenEXR from source.</p>
			<p>There are two primary ways to connect with the OpenEXR project:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p>The <a href="mailto:openexr-dev@lists.aswf.io">openexr-dev@lists.aswf.io</a> mail list: This is a development focused mail list with a deep history of technical conversations and decisions that have shaped the project. Subscribe at 
				<a href="https://lists.aswf.io/g/openexr-dev">openexr-dev</a>.</p></li>
			<li><p>GitHub Issues: GitHub issues are used both to track bugs and to 
				discuss feature requests.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="how-to-ask-for-help">How to Ask for Help</h3>
			<p>If you have trouble installing, building, or using the library, but 
				there’s not yet reason to suspect you’ve encountered a genuine bug, 
				start by posting a question to the 
				<a href="https://lists.aswf.io/g/openexr-dev">openexr-dev</a> mailing list. This is the place for question such has “How do I…”.</p>
			<h3 id="how-to-report-a-bug">How to Report a Bug</h3>
			<p>OpenEXR use GitHub’s issue tracking system for 
				<a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/issues">bugs and enhancements</a>.
				</p>

			<ul>
			<li>what you tried</li>
			<li>what happened</li>
			<li>what you expected to happen instead</li>
			</ul>
			<p>with enough detail that others can reproduce the problem.</p>
