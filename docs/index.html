			<h3 id="the-openexr-file-format">The OpenEXR File Format</h3>
			<hr class="sub-divider">	
			<p>The purpose of the OpenEXR format is to accurately and efficiently represent high-dynamic-range scene-linear image data and associated metadata, with strong support for multi-part, multi-channel use cases.</p>
			<p>OpenEXR is widely used in host application software where accuracy is critical, such as photorealistic rendering, texture access, image compositing, deep compositing, and DI.</p>
			<p>OpenEXR is a project of the 
				<a href="https://www.aswf.io">Academy Software Foundation</a>.
			OpenEXR is included in the 
				<a href="https://vfxplatform.com">VFX Reference Platform</a>.
			</p>
			<h3 id="openexr-features">OpenEXR Features</h3>
			<hr class="sub-divider">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>High dynamic range and color precision.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and 32-bit integer pixels.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Multiple image compression algorithms, both lossless and lossy. Some of the included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with film grain. The lossy codecs have been tuned for visual quality and decoding performance.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR applications.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Support for stereoscopic image workflows and a generalization to multi-views.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Flexible support for deep data: pixels can store a variable-length list of samples and, thus, it is possible to store multiple values at different depths for each pixel. Hard surfaces and volumetric data representations are accommodated.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Multipart: ability to encode separate, but related, images in one file. This allows for access to individual parts without the need to read other parts in the file.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Versioning: OpenEXR source allows for user configurable C++ namespaces to provide protection when using multiple versions of the library in the same process space.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="the-openexr-project-mission">The OpenEXR Project Mission</h3>
			<hr class="sub-divider">
			<p>The goal of the OpenEXR project is to keep the EXR format reliable and modern and to maintain its place as the preferred image format for entertainment content creation.</p>
			<p>Major revisions are infrequent, and new features will be carefully weighed against increased complexity. The principal priorities of the project are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Robustness, reliability, security</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Backwards compatibility, data longevity</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Performance - read/write/compression/decompression time</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Simplicity, ease of use, maintainability</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Wide adoption, multi-platform support - Linux, Windows, macOS, and others</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>OpenEXR is intended solely for 2D data. It is not appropriate for storage of volumetric data, cached or lit 3D scenes, or more complex 3D data such as light fields.</p>
			<p>The goals of the IlmBase project are simplicity, ease of use, correctness and verifiability, and breadth of adoption. IlmBase is not intended to be a comprehensive linear algebra or numerical analysis package.</p>
