				The image on the left shows an exposure setting of 0. 
				The middle image displays the image 4 stops darker, 
				revealing details from the glaring sunlight. The image 
				on the right is 8 stops darker, and even more details 
				emerge from outside the window.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				With a program like Photoshop that is capable of working 
				with and displaying high dynamic range images, changing 
				the exposure does not affect the image data itself, it 
				simply changes the way that the original 16-bit floating-point 
				pixel values in the image are converted to 8-bit integer data 
				in the frame buffer of the display device. We call the original 
				16-bit pixels the "raw" image data, and the converted 8-bit pixels 
				the "cooked" image data. When you change the exposure, you are 
				"re-cooking" the data.

			<p><h3><a name="origins">The Origins of OpenEXR</a></h3>
			<hr class="sub-divider">

			<p>Industrial Light & Magic developed the OpenEXR format in 
			response to the demand for higher color fidelity in the visual 
			effects industry. When the project began in 2000, ILM evaluated 
			existing file formats, but rejected them for various reasons:</p>

			<ul>
			<li><p>8- and 10-bit formats lack the dynamic range necessary to store
			high-contrast images captured from HDR devices.</p></li>

			<li><p>16-bit integer-based formats typically represent color component
			values from 0  ("black") to 1 ("white"), but don't account for
			over-range values (e.g., a chrome highlight) that can be captured by film
			negative or other HDR devices.  For images intended only for
			display or print reproduction, clamping at "white" may be sufficient;
			but for image processing in a visual effects house, highlights often
			need to be preserved in the image data.  Preserving over-range values in
			the source image  allows an artist to change the apparent
			exposure of the image with minimal loss of data, for example.</p></li>

			<li><p>Conversely, 32-bit floating-point TIFF is often overkill for visual
			effects work.  32-bit FP TIFF provides more than sufficient precision
			and dynamic range for VFX images, but it comes at the cost of storage,
			both on disk and in memory.  When creating background plates for VFX
			work, film is usually scanned in at 2k pixels wide or more, and
			24p HD images are 1920x1080, so background plates are already quite
			large relative to "typical" digital images.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>In 2000, ILM decided to develop a new HDR file format with color
			  component values stored in a new 16-bit floating-point type called
			  "half." This type is now compatible with the IEEE-754-2008 standard,
			  although note that this standard was not adopted until 2008, several
			  years after the develoment on OpenEXR.</p>

			<p>
			</p>

                        <ul>
			<li>
				<p>Half values have 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, and 10 mantissa
				bits. For linear images, this format provides 1024 (210) values per
				color component per f-stop, and 30 f-stops (25 - 2), with an
				additional 10 f-stops with reduced precision at the low end
				(denormals).</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
			        <p>The half format supports denormalized numbers, positive and negative
				infinities, and NaNs. It is identical to the half data type in
				NVIDIA's CUDA platform, allowing a developer to process values from an
				OpenEXR image directly on current NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p>In addition to the half data type, OpenEXR supports 32-bit unsigned
				integer and 32-bit floating-point data types. OpenEXR images can have
				an arbitrary number of channels, each with a different data type.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p>OpenEXR supports several lossless compression methods, some of which
				can achieve compression ratios of about 2:1 for images with film
				grain. OpenEXR is extensible, so developers can easily add new
				compression methods (lossless or lossy).</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>OpenEXR images can be annotated with an arbitrary number of
				attributes, e.g., with color balance information from a camera.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p>OpenEXR images are able to support stereoscopic workflows by holding
				multiple views resident in a single image file.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p>OpenEXR also supports storing "Deep Data" buffers wherein pixels are
				capable of holding variable number of data samples, particularly as
				pertaining to depth. The implementation is capable of both hard
				surface and volumetric representation requirements for deep
				compositing workflows.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p>OpenEXR also has the concept of "Multi-Part" files that contain a
				number of separate, but related, images in one file. Access to any
				part is independent of the others.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><a name="features">Imath</a></h3>
			<hr class="sub-divider">			
			<p>
				The half type is now distributed as a part of the Imath library, along
				with other C++ classes that represent 2D and 3D vectors and matrices
				and other simple but useful mathematical objects, functions, and data
				types common in computer graphics applications. These classes were
				originally distributed as the IlmBase library as a component of
				OpenEXR, but as of the the 3.0 release of OpenEXR in late 2020, Imath
				is now distributed independently of OpenEXR, although it continues to
				be maintained by the OpenEXR project.

			<hr class="sub-divider">
			
			<p>
			OpenEXR is a project of the <a href="https://www.aswf.io">Academy Software
			Foundation</a>.  The format and library were
			originally developed by Industrial Light & Magic and first released in
			2003.  Weta Digital, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Sony Pictures
			Imageworks, Pixar Animation Studios, DreamWorks, and other studios,
			companies, and individuals have made contributions to the code base.
			OpenEXR was adopted by the ASWF in 2019.
